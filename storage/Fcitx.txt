Fcitx should be launched by KWin under KDE Wayland in order to use Wayland input method frontend. This can improve the experience when using Fcitx on Wayland. To configure this, you need to go to "System Settings" -> "Virtual keyboard" and select "Fcitx 5" from it. You may also need to disable tools that launches input method, such as imsettings on Fedora, or im-config on Debian/Ubuntu. For more details see https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Using_Fcitx_5_on_Wayland#KDE_Plasma 
Detect GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE being set and Wayland Input method frontend is working. It is recommended to unset GTK_IM_MODULE and QT_IM_MODULE and use Wayland input method frontend instead. For more details see https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Using_Fcitx_5_on_Wayland#KDE_Plasma
